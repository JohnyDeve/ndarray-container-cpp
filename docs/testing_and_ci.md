# Testing & Continuous Integration

NDArray includes a full validation pipeline based on GoogleTest and GitHub Actions.

---

# Unit Tests

Tests are located in:

`tests/tests.cpp`

The test suite validates:

* iterator behavior
* recursive initialization
* copy/move semantics
* contiguous traversal
* const-correctness
* exception-sensitive operations

---

# GoogleTest Integration

The project uses GoogleTest through CMake FetchContent integration.

Tests are automatically registered using:

```cmake
include(GoogleTest)
gtest_discover_tests(ndarray_tests)
```

---

# Running Tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

---

# clang-format Verification

Formatting consistency is verified automatically in CI.

Example:

```bash
clang-format --dry-run --Werror include/NDArray.hpp tests/tests.cpp
```

---

# GitHub Actions

The CI pipeline automatically performs:

* project configuration
* compilation
* unit-test execution
* formatting validation

on every push and pull request.
